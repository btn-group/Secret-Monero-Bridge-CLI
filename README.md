# Secret-Monero-Bridge-CLI
Secret Monero Bridge Command Line Interface (CLI)

Enables performing Secret Monero Bridge deposits and withdrawals via a command line interface instead of the web based Dapp and the Keplr wallet extension.

You will need to have the secretcli installed on your machine (see https://docs.scrt.network/node-guides/secretcli.html#secret-network-light-client )

This pre-release code is for broader testing purposes. Report any issues to smb@i2pmail.org
